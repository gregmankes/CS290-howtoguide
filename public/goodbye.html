					<h3>API Key</h3>
					<p>
						One of the things that you may have wondered was why you needed to register for the API key in the first place. Well as I mentioned before, the BLS API has a limit on how many requests you can send anonymously per day. In fact, it is pretty limited as you can only do 25 requests per day without registration. 
						<br><br>
						In order to get around this, you need only do two things:
						<ul>
							<li>GET
								<ul>
									<li>You need to change the api version of the url and include a key=value combination for the api key
									</li>
									<li>
										This can be done with the following: <code>http://api.bls.gov/publicAPI/v2/timeseries/data/LAUCN040010000000005?registrationKey=xxxxxxxxxxxxyourAPIKeyxxxxxxxxx</code>
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>POST
								<ul>
									<li>You need to add the registration key to the body of the JSON Payload</li>
									<li>This can be done with the following: <code>"body":
			        					'{"seriesid":["APU0000701322"], "registrationKey":"xxxxxxxxxxxxyourAPIKeyxxxxxxxxx"}'</code>
			        				</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<br>
						You now have a working knowledge of API's and how to use them. You also should know how to access the BLS data using version 1 and 2 of their API. You can also parse that data and use it for your own applications.
