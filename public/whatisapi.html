					<h1>What is an API</h1>
					<h3>Definition and uses</h3>
					<br>
					<h3>Definition</h3>
					<p>An API is an application programming interface. This may sound like a bunch of technical jargon but it is used heavily in computer programming as a means for one application to transfer information to another. There are many API’s out there and to be able to understand and use them is extremely useful.</p>
					<br>
					<h3>Example</h3>
					<p>An API is like a car’s interface. You know that you can press on the gas to accelerate and the brakes to decelerate, but how the car actually does either of those two things is of no concern to you. It is then up to the driver to use other controls and stimuli to steer the car to his location. This is how the API works. We access the data through calls to the API and we are responsible for using this data for our application.</p>
