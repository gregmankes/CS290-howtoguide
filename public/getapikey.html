		<h1>Obtaining an API Key</h1>
		<h3>Used for making repeated API calls</h3>
		<br>
		<h3>What is an API Key and why do we need one?</h3>
		<p>This key is used to identify calls to the API to you. So keep this private so that it cannot be abused. <br>For the bureau of labor statistics, there are two ways to make API calls. For simplicityâ€™s sake, we will be using version 1 of their API, which does not require you to have an API key. However, at the end you may use version 2 of their API so that you can obtain more information, which requires an API key. <br>Go to <a href="http://data.bls.gov/registrationEngine/">http://data.bls.gov/registrationEngine/</a> in order to register.
