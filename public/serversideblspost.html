					<h3>Getting more information with POST</h3>
					<p>
						Letâ€™s say we want to make a post request like we did before and get more information at one time from the BLS API. All we need to do here is change the request call to be a json object in the request call. We do this below in the <code>app.get</code> function. If you would like, you may copy the following code into a new file with a .js extension and run the command <code>node (newFileName.js)</code>.

							<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/mankesg/sd6c5dfk/embedded/js/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>
						<br><br>
						We can then run our application and look at localhost:3000 and see the following response
						<br><br>

						<br><br>
						From the picture here you can see that we now have two series ids that are showing up in the response.
						<br>
						What we need to do in order to make the request is pass the request function a JSON object that contains a few things.
						<br>
						These are:
						<ul>
							<li>A <code>url</code> property that has the value of the url</li>
							<li>A <code>method</code> property that has the value of <code>POST</code></li>
							<li>A <code>headers</code> property that has the value of <code>application/json</code></li>
							<li>A <code>body</code> property that has a nested JSON object that is the payload.</li>
						</ul>
						The nested JSON object is the same type of payload in the same format as we had done before using the ARC.
					</p>
